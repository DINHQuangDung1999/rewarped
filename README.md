# Rewarped

Rewarped ðŸŒ€ is a platform for reinforcement learning in parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation, built on [`NVIDIA/warp`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp). Rewarped supports:

- **parallel environments**: to train RL agents at scale.
- **differentiable simulation**: to compute batched analytic gradients for optimization.
- **multiphysics**: (CRBA, FEM, MPM, XPBD) physics solvers and coupling to support interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and various deformables.

We use Rewarped to *re-implement* a variety of RL tasks from prior works, and demonstrate that first-order model-based RL algorithms (which use differentiable simulation to compute analytic policy gradients) can be scaled to a range of challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables.
